# TherapySmart
For the ByteKode 2021 Hackathon

This app falls under the theme of 'Quality of Life' and aims to improve patients' lives by centralising and taking care of hteir medications, from remindigngh them to take 
their medications, to find the closest pharmacies who canresotck patients' supplies. It is in its early stages and is very foundational, but I do hope that it grows in the future.
It was tough, but worth it.
